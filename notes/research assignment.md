### Crafting a Thesis Statement

For the question, _"How will technological innovations become a threat to data security, and how have these threats been mitigated?"_, a strong thesis could look like this:

> **Technological innovations, such as AI, IoT, and quantum computing, pose significant threats to data security by exposing vulnerabilities in current systems; however, these challenges are being mitigated through advancements in encryption, regulatory frameworks, and privacy-focused design.**

---

### Choosing a Research Document

- **Type**: Analytical or argumentative research essay.
    - **Analytical**: Breaks down how innovations create threats and examines mitigation efforts.
    - **Argumentative**: Presents a stance, e.g., "Mitigation strategies are sufficient to combat emerging threats" or "More aggressive measures are needed to protect data security."

---

### Sources to Focus On

1. **Peer-reviewed Journals**: Articles from computer science, cybersecurity, or legal studies.
2. **Industry Reports**: Publications from organizations like Gartner, IBM Security, or Cloudflare.
3. **Case Studies**: Analyses of real-world breaches or successful mitigations.
4. **Government and Regulatory Publications**: Documents on GDPR, CCPA, or NIST frameworks.
5. **Tech News Outlets**: Reputable sources like Wired, Ars Technica, or TechCrunch for current examples.
