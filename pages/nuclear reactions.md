- atomic number and mass number
	- when the symbol for an element is used in a nuclear reaction, the atomic number and the mass number are written as subscripts and superscripts preceding the element's symbol.
	- the atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. the number of protons defines an element.
	- the mass number can show three important values
		- the mass number is the number of protons and neutrons.
			- since the atomic number is the number of protons only, the number of neutrons can be deduced.
		- the mass number is also the atomic mass.
		- the mass number is also the molar mass.(mass of one mole of atoms)
			- measured in grams per mole
- subatomic particles
	- notes:
	  collapsed:: true
		- it is important to know the mass and atomic number of these basic particles when analyzing nuclear reactions
	- fundamental particles, like protons and neutrons, are most likely to be encountered in nuclear reactions.

- neutrino
	- are often a product of radioactive decay and nuclear reactions.
	- A neutrino,ν_e, is a neutral particle with very little mass.
	- are more common in the universe than electrons and protons.
	- they do not interact with matter
