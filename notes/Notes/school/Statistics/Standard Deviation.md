Standard Deviation defines how varied a set of variables are. The higher the variable, the less [[review#^9d19ff|precise]] the variables are. ^cdf18c

the formula is given with this equation:$$s=\sqrt{\dfrac{\Sigma(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{(n-1)}}$$
where $x_i$ are the samples, $\bar x$ is the mean, and $n$ is the number of samples.
However, such an arbitrary number doesn't really tell much. This is where the standard Error of mean comes in.
