This story is very impactful and heartbreaking, because it challenges the social issues that we hold as acceptable. It should not just something that factory owners or union members read to be wary about, but also by us, the public. We should be aware of these issues that are present in our communities so that we can come together for change. Factory workers like Rose aren't as uncommon as one might think, which makes change urgent. Because of this, we must spread the word about stories like these in order to raise social awareness, something Rose hoped to achieve by publishing this story. This story will be one of the many stories that we will use not only to push for change, but rally people as well. Due to Rose's background, it is able to touch the hearts of many people of similar background, increasing the population pushing for change.
