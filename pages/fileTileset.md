- have several proprietary files
- use numbers encrypted in hex to store data
- use data to create map
- have two files
	- one dictates what one world is, what the blocks situation is(hitbox, properties, yareyare), which is placed in db/world/*.mydw
	- another dictates the specific level and how the level is laid out, the background, etc. which is placed in db/levels/*.mydl
- when level is being drawn, the engine would have to specify which world corresponds to which level, so that when rendering the correct textures can be loaded
- easter egg
	- have one file of each two types be more organized than the other ones
