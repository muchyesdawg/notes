	- the theory that matter is composed of indivisible unites, or atoms, come from the ancient Greeks.
	- At the turn of the nineteenth century, scientists changed a lot of their previous ideas about the composition and behavior of atoms
- development of the atomic theory
	- several observations and prominent experiments have led to a greater understanding of atoms.
	- this section will cover the scientists that made such discoveries.
		- J.J. Thomson
		  collapsed:: true
			- 1897
			- discovered that even atoms were divisible.
			- discovered the electron
			- theorized that an atom of matter has a mixture of positive and negative components.
			- created the "raisin cake model", or the "plum-pudding model".
		- Ernest Rutherford
		  collapsed:: true
			- a student of J.J. Thomson
			- made an experiment with charged rays from uranium crystals, and named then alpha and beta
			- he determined that they consist of streams of particles.
			- confirmed that the alpha particle is a doubly charged proton.(now known as a nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons)
			- used radioactive source to fire alpha particles through a thin sheet of gold foil
			- a screen sensitive to alpha particles surrounded the gold foil to record the strikes of alpha particles
			- if Thomson's model was right, the distribution of positive and negative components of gold atoms shouldn't greatly affect the path of positive alpha particles.
			- the evidence he wanted that would reflect his hypothesis was that there shouldn't be too many alpha particles deflected.
			- the result was some of the alpha particles deflected at extreme angles.
			- proposed that
				- the positive region inside the gold atoms were actually concentrated in a very tiny nucleus at its center.
				- atoms are mostly empty space
				- majority of the mass of an atom is concentrated in a tiny central nucleus
				- central nucleus is positively charged.
				- electrons orbit the nucleus
				-
		- Max Planck
			- wanted to explain the color spectrum seen when substances were heated to the point of glowing.
			- light emitted was due to atomic oscillations.
			- patterns seen could be explained only if assumed that atomic oscillations had very specific quantities of energy.
			- suggested that the oscillations were quantized.
			- was able to develop a mathematical relationship for the oscillations.
			- determined that it was based on a constant
			- called the constant as Planck's constant
				- h
				- 6.63*10^-34 joule⋅seconds
				- 4.14*10^-15 electron volt⋅seconds.
		- Albert Einstein
			- applied Planck's idea of quantization of electromagnetic radiation
			- suggested that light is quantized and it consists of massless, particle-like packets that have a specific quantity of energy
			- these packets came to be known as photons. determined that the energy of a photon, E, is product of h and frequency
		- Niels Bohr
			- suggested a model of the atom that explained why electrons do not fall into the nucleus and why the light emitted from excited atoms produces the oberved emmision spectra
			- theorized that the elctrons could occpy exact energy levels.
			- absorption and emission of specific wavelengs of light are related to
