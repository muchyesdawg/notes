- ### Photorespiration
	- is a result from dehydration
		- What happens on dehydration?
			- stopping $H_2O$ from leaving the system
			- stomata is closed
		- What happens as a result?
			- less access to $CO_2$ 
			- more buildup of $O_2$
			- perfect conditions for photorespiration
	- What happens during photorespiration?
		1. Within [[Calvin Cycle]], instead of $CO_2$, $O_2$ is used
			- this makes a two-carbon compound
		2. Consuming  $O_2$ to and organic fuel
		3. release $CO_2$ without producing ATP or sugar.
	- Why?
	- How did it appear?
		- Believed to have occured when rubisco first
