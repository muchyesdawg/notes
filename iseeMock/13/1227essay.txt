Describe a time when you experienced failure. how did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?
    
    One time in Hong Kong, my parents brought us to an old toy store where it sold 
old Hong Kong toys there. I found a snake thing that interested me, which is present day
Rubik's twist. My brother, being more older and mature than me, bought a Rubiks cube.
At the time, there wasn't much that interested me about the Rubik's cube, because it was 
boring. I found more interest in the snake toy.
    Few years later, when our family was going to church, I noticed my brother still twisting
the cube of colors. I asked," you have been playing with that for years now, and you haven't solved it yet?" in Chinese.
He responded with, "if you are so good, then you try solving it." So he borrowed me the cube. I tried for quite some time.
Trial and error, trial and error, with constant failure. I was fustrated every time the cube was mixed up
and was thrilled when I progressed in solving by even a little. Two weeks later, I solved it, and showed it to my brother.
The Rubik's cube got me into puzzles. All types of puzzles, be it physical or digital, were within my expertise, which was all lead by one small cube.
