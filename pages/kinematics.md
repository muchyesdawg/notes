	  $$\Delta x=\frac{(v_f+v_i)t}{2}$$
		- this works because the shape below the line is a trapezoid

			- the smaller base of the trapezoid is $$v_i$$, and the bigger base is $$v_f$$
			-
		- the equation is essentially the area of a trapezoid
	- collapsed:: true
	  $$v_f=v_i+at$$
		- this equation uses the properties of $$a$$, where $$a$$ is the acceleration of object/slope of the graph
		- since $$slope=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$, then $$slope\: \cdot\: \Delta x = \Delta y$$, rewritten as $$at = \Delta v$$

	  $$x_f=x_i+v_it+\dfrac{at^2}{2}$$
		- each of these terms do different to essentially build the trapezoid as mentioned in

		- the trapezoid can be split into two parts, a square and a triangle
		- the square is calculated by $$v_i$$
		- the triangle is calculated by taking half of multiplying $$t$$ with the difference of $$v_i $$ and $$ v_f$$, or $$at$$, giving us $$\dfrac{at^2}{2}$$,

		- the $$x_i$$ can be taken out if not necessary, as it only adds previous displacement

	  $$v^2_f=v^2_i+2a\Delta x$$
		- the $$\Delta x$$ can be changed to $$t^2$$ or $$(x-x_0)$$ or just $$s$$
		- this works by forming a square with the side length of $$v_f$$
		- the reason behind $$2a\Delta x$$ is because by multiplying the trapezoids by a, we get a trapezoid with the height equaling to the difference of $$v_i$$ and $$v_f$$
		- the equaling height and difference creates a trapezoid with a slope of 1, which allows it to be multiplied by two, forming the square of $$v_f$$
