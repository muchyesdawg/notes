In the formula for the **directional derivative**, several pieces of notation are involved, each with a specific meaning. Letâ€™s break down all the notation step by step:

### 1. **Function**: \( f(x, y) \)
- This is the scalar function whose rate of change you're interested in. It takes two inputs \( x \) and \( y \) and outputs a scalar value.
- For example, \( f(x, y) \) could represent the height of a surface at the point \( (x, y) \).

### 2. **Partial Derivatives**: \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \)
- These represent the rate of change of the function in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, respectively.
- \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \) tells you how \( f \) changes as \( x \) changes, holding \( y \) constant.
- \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) tells you how \( f \) changes as \( y \) changes, holding \( x \) constant.

### 3. **Gradient**: \( \nabla f(x, y) \)
- The **gradient** is a vector that collects all the partial derivatives of the function. For a function of two variables, it is:
  
  \[
  \nabla f(x, y) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right)
  \]
  
- It points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function \( f(x, y) \) and its magnitude indicates how quickly the function increases in that direction.

### 4. **Unit Vector**: \( $$\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y) $$\)
- The **unit vector** \( \mathbf{v} \) specifies the direction in which you want to compute the rate of change of the function.
- \( \mathbf{v} \) must be a unit vector, meaning it has a magnitude of 1. This ensures that the directional derivative represents the rate of change per unit distance in the given direction.
- A unit vector is typically represented as \( \mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y) \), where \( v_x \) and \( v_y \) are the components of the vector in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, respectively.
- To be a unit vector, it must satisfy:
  
  \[
  \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = 1
  \]

### 5. **Directional Derivative**: \( $$D_{\mathbf{v}} f(x, y) $$\)
- The **directional derivative** \( D_{\mathbf{v}} f(x, y) \) represents the rate of change of the function \( f(x, y) \) in the direction specified by the vector \( \mathbf{v} \).
  
  \[
  D_{\mathbf{v}} f(x, y) = \nabla f(x, y) \cdot \mathbf{v}
  \]
  
- It generalizes the concept of a partial derivative by allowing you to calculate the rate of change along any direction, not just along the coordinate axes.

### 6. **Dot Product**: \($\nabla f(x, y) \cdot \mathbf{v}$\)
- The **dot product** is an operation between two vectors that results in a scalar (a number). In this case, you are taking the dot product of the gradient \( \nabla f(x, y) \) and the unit vector \( \mathbf{v} \).
- For two vectors \( \mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2) \) and \( \mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2) \), the dot product is:

  \[
  \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2
  \]

- Applied to the gradient and the unit vector \( \mathbf{v} \), this becomes:

  \[
  D_{\mathbf{v}} f(x, y) = \nabla f(x, y) \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} v_x + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} v_y
  \]

- The result tells you the rate of change of the function in the direction of \( \mathbf{v} \).

### Putting It All Together:
The **directional derivative** \( D_{\mathbf{v}} f(x, y) \) is the rate of change of the function \( f(x, y) \) in the direction of the unit vector \( \mathbf{v} \). It is computed as the dot product of the gradient \( \nabla f(x, y) \) and the direction vector \( \mathbf{v} \).

Mathematically:

\[
D_{\mathbf{v}} f(x, y) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} v_x + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} v_y
\]

Where:
- \( \nabla f(x, y) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) \) is the gradient.
- \( \mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y) \) is the unit vector indicating the direction of interest.

This formula gives the rate of change of \( f(x, y) \) as you move in the direction of \( \mathbf{v} \).
