- thermodynamics
	- a branch of physics
	- deals with thermal energy and heat.
- variables
	- U internal energy   in joules
	- e  efficiency           in percentages
- internal energy
	- represented with the variable U
	- is the total energy of a system.
	- Thermodynamics is more concerned with delta U rather than actual value of U
	- ΔU = ΔE_thermal
	- thermal energy of a gas is sum of all microscopic kinetic energies of gas particles
	- Δ=3/2nRΔT
		- unlikely that this equation will appear on exam
		- used to show important direct relationship between temperature change and change in internal energy.
