- periodic table
  collapsed:: true
	- a table of elements
	- organised in groups(vertical columns) and periods(horizontal columns)
	- shows atomic number of the elements
		- atomic number shows amount of protons within an atom
		- 1 proton equates to one amu(atmoic mass unit)
	- shows subshell areas
		- group 1(1A) and 2(2A) are the s subshell
			- s subshell contains two electrons
		- group 3 to 12 are the d subshell
			- transition metals
			- contains 10 electrons
		- groups 13(3A) to 18(8A) are the p subshell
			- metals, metalloids and noble gases
			- contains 6 electrons
			- excludes helium(but still a noble gas)
- atoms
  collapsed:: true
	- nucleus
		- nucleus has protons and neutrons
			- protons are positively charged
			- neutrons are neutral
				- are basically protons and electrons mushed together, which creates the neutral charge(maybe???)
			- both have 1 amu
			- atomic weight is the sum of number of protons and number of neutrons
			- protons define the element but neutrons define its variant
			- atoms with different amount of protons are different elements
			- atoms with the same amount of protons but different amount of neutrons are the same element but different isotopes
				- isotopes are atoms that are the same elements but vary in neutrons
				- isotopes can be chemically identical but very different
					- example:
						- carbon-12 and carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon
						- carbon-12 and carbon-14 both have 6 protons and electrons
						- carbon-12 has 6 neutrons while carbon-14 has 8
						- isotopes, like carbon-14, are radioactive, thus are called ((63b2624c-f5fb-4bc0-9db1-effa51a49dc4))
						- ((63b2624c-f5fb-4bc0-9db1-effa51a49dc4)) emits particles and decay at a known rate
							- this is called ((63896930-8f4e-4efc-afbb-f8b1259c222d))
	- electrons
	  id:: 63c33173-3cdd-4490-a8f0-46eb36dc6907
		- exist in an orbital(the spdf subshells)
			- atoms (normally) have the same amount electrons as there are protons
				- if number of protons and electrons aren't equal, the atoms becomes an ion
					- a cation is when there are less electrons than protons
						- since protons are positively charged, the protons overpower the electrons and the atom becomes positively charged(becomes a cation)
					- an anion is when there are more electrons than protons
						- since electrons are negatively charged charged, the electrons overpower the protons and the atom becomes negatively charged(becomes a anion)
		- are used for bonding
			- a bond is formed when two atomic nuclei attract the same electrons
			- exists in different types
				- ((63b9c5ca-c674-45f2-b863-63ca13fa7426))
				- ((63896930-4ad3-4361-ac85-b74301e9aad5))
				- ((63896930-dd21-4d6e-8bfd-6376aebc8b0d))
					- is one of the factors of determining of something is ((63896930-9e0f-4373-9b14-4131f25fc845)) or ((63896930-3bba-46c8-bb6a-559122e7c1b3))
					- has two types
						- is one of the factors of determining of something is ((63896930-9e0f-4373-9b14-4131f25fc845)) or ((63896930-3bba-46c8-bb6a-559122e7c1b3))
						- polar
							- electrons shared non equally
							- has no partial charge
							- formed between any two atoms that aren't alike
							- is the basis of ((63896930-4ad3-4361-ac85-b74301e9aad5))
						- nonpolar
						  id:: 63b9c69b-d4ef-4d74-9ac9-246bc3d426ff
							- electrons shared equally
							- has partial charge
							- formed between any two atoms that are alike
