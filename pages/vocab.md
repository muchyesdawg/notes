- # KINEMATICS
	- ## displacement
		- straight line distance bewteen the initial and final points
		- has both magnitude and direction
		- symbol is delta x, delta means change, x means position
		- change in position of an object - delta x = xf-xi
		- can either be positive and negative
		- displacement doesn't equal distance
	- ## distance
		- scalar(magnitude only)
		- path length traveled from one location to another, varies depending on the path
	- ## velocity
		- symbol, v
		- equation is v=deltax/deltat
		- has magnitude and direction
		- units m/s
	- ## speed
		- distance traveled over time
		- avg speed = total distance traveled/ total time
		- units m/s
