They are similar to [[Scalars]]. However, they include a direction. Basically a 2D scalar.
There are several ways to represent vectors, which are shown by the little arrow on top, like this: $\vec v$
$$\langle x,y\rangle$$$$(r,\theta)$$
$$\vec v = x\hat i+y\hat{j}$$
this can be generalized to $\mathbb{R} ^3$.
when the magnitude of a vector is equal to 1, the vector is known as a [[unit vector|unit vector]], $\hat{v}$.
