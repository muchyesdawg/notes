- thermodynamics
	- a branch of physics
	- deals with thermal energy and heat.
- variables
	- U internal energy   in joules
	- e  efficiency           in percentages
- internal energy
	- represented with the variable U
	- is the total energy of a system.
	- Thermodynamics is more concerned with delta U rather than actual value of U
	- ΔU = ΔE_thermal
	- thermal energy of a gas is sum of all microscopic kinetic energies of gas particles
	- Δ=3/2nRΔT
		- unlikely that this equation will appear on exam
		- used to show important direct relationship between temperature change and change in internal energy.
	- during thermodynamic process there are three possibilities for the value of internal energy.
	- there are three possibilities for value of internal energy.
		- internal energy increases
			- if energy is added to the system, the internal system increases, +ΔU. This is accompanied by an increase in the temperature of the system +ΔT.
		- internal energy decreases
			- if energy is removed from the system, the internal energy decreases. -ΔD. this is accompanied by a decrease in the temperature of the system -ΔT.
		- isothermal process
			- this is a thermodynamic process where the temperature remains constant, ΔT=0.
			- if temperature is not changing, then the internal energy is not changing. ΔU=0
- work
	- work is a mechanical way to add or remove energy.
	- represented with W
	- is visible
	- it's a macroscopic transfer of energy involving a net force acting a through a distance.

	- example

		- there is a cylinder, a movable piston, and gas particles that are trapped by said piston.
			- under some conditions, the pressure of the gas changes when work moves the piston.
			- but under special conditions, pressure remains constant as the piston moves. (this is known as an isobaric process).
				- W=-PΔV
- heat
	- represented with Q
	- is a microscopic(invisible)
	- transfers thermal energy between objects having different temperatures.
	- example of heat reservoir could be air or water surrounding the cylinder
	- energy transferred into or out of the reservoir is negligible compared with the huge size of the reservoir.
	- heat flows from high to low temperatures(as most types of energies do)
	- ways heat can be transferred
		- heat added
			- if an object has lower temperature than it's environment, then the heat would transfer from the environment to the object, effectively adding heat.
			- +ΔU, +Q
		- heat removed
			- if an object has a higher temperature than it's environment, then the heat would transfer from that object to it's environment, effectively dissipating the heat
			- -ΔU, -Q
		- adiabatic process
			- no change in heat.
			- happens when an object's temperature and it's environment's temperature is at equilibrium
			- ΔU = 0, Q = 0
- efficiency
	- the heat added to an engine, Q_H can be thought of as thermal fuel
	- heat removed from engine, Q_C can be thought of as thermal exhaust
	- engine exhaust is not efficient, but no heat engine can operate without some exhaust at low temp, T_C.
	- the warm engine of a car after it has been running is an example of T_c waste heat Q_c
	- engine efficiency is the relationship between net work W_net produced by engine to the heat added, Q_H
	- e=|W_net/Q_H|
	- heat engines have theoretical maximum efficiency.
	- calculated using the temperature extremes, T_H and T_C.
	- the best possible efficiency of a heat engine is calculated with e=(T_H-T_C)/T_H
	- calculations with this formula require kelvin temps.
- entropy
	- entropy is a way to quantify the probability of finding a system in a particular state.
	- is basically how messy something is.
	- if something has a low probability of happening in an isolated system, it has low entropy.
	- if something has a higher probability of happening in an isolated system, it has high entropy.
	- probability drives systems toward random and disordered equilibrium states with higher entropy.
- laws of thermodynamics
	- first law of thermodynamics
		- conservation of energy
			- no change in energy
	- second law of thermodynamics
		- entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease
		- entropy of isolated systems always increase until system reaches equilibrium
		- once at equilibrium, entropy of system remains constant
