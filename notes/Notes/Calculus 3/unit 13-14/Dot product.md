$\vec u \cdot \vec v$ denotes the dot product of vectors $\vec u \text{ and } \vec v$. 
The Theorem for dot product is as follows:
$$\vec u \cdot \vec v = \sum_{i=1}^nu_iv_i=|u||v|\cos\theta$$
Knowing this, we can see that when two vectors become [[orthogonal]], the dot product of two vectors become $\cos\theta=\cos90=0$.
