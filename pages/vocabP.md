	- ## displacement #vocabp
		- straight line distance bewteen the initial and final points
		- has both magnitude and direction
		- symbol is delta x, delta means change, x means position
		- change in position of an object - delta x = xf-xi
		- can either be positive and negative
		- displacement doesn't equal distance
		- area under a velocity time graph
	- ## distance#vocabp
		- scalar(magnitude only)
		- path length traveled from one location to another, varies depending on the path
	- ## velocity#vocabp
		- symbol, $$v$$
		- equation is v=deltax/deltat
		- has magnitude and direction
		- units m/s
	- ## speed#vocabp
		- distance traveled over time
		- avg speed = total distance traveled/ total time
		- units m/s
	- ## Acceleration #vocabp
		- rate of change of velocity
		- opposite of deceleration
		- a vector
		- symbol $$a$$
		- positive acceleration increases velocity
		- can be caused by change of speed/direction
		- $$A_{avg}=\dfrac{V_f-V_i}{t}$$
		-
		- $$V_f=V_i+at$$

		- ## kinematics #vocabP
			- objects in motion
		- ## hooke's law
		  id:: 652ff1bf-9dd5-4f69-9e02-9528a7a9d070
			- $$f_{spring}=-kx$$
			- where $$k$$ is spring constant, and $$x$$ is the displacement
			-
- # FORCES
	- ## gravitational forces
	- ## inverse square law
		- at a distance $$r$$, the energy on an object is $$E$$
		- as the object moves further $$\Delta Dr$$, then the energy on the object will be $$\dfrac{E}{\Delta D^2}$$
		- as the object moves closer $$\Delta Dr$$, the energy on the object will be $$E\cdot\Delta D^2$$

- # ROTATIONAL MOTION
  id:: 652816f3-7a17-46c0-844b-5571b67cd789
	- motion of a body that spins about an axis
	- ### rotation
		- when an object turns about an internal axis
	- ### revolution
		- when an object turns about an external
	- ### uniform circular motion
	  id:: 652816f3-cf73-4806-ae03-b66268cdd474
		- motion in which there is not change in speed, only a change in direction
		- constant speed and motion
		- #### period
		  id:: 65281526-1448-4be6-b9c2-b2935f5e5bab
			- time it takes for one full rotation/revolution of an object
			- equation $$T=\dfrac{1}{f}$$ or $$R/t$$
			- units is $$T$$
			- units:seconds $$s$$
		- #### frequency
			- number of rotations or revolutions per unit time
			- units $$Hz,s^{-1}$$
			- equation $$f = \frac{1}{T}$$
			- inversely proportional with ((65281526-1448-4be6-b9c2-b2935f5e5bab))
	- ### tangential speed
		- speed of something moving along a circular path
		- direction of a motion is always tangent to the circle.
		- $$V_t=\dfrac{2\pi r}{T}$$
	- ### rotational speed(angular speed)
		- number of rotations per unit of time
	- ### centripetal force
		- any force that causes an object to follow a circular path
		- always directed to the center
		- inertia is tangential to the circle
		- $$a_c=\dfrac{V^2_T}{r}$$
	- ### centrifugal force
		- not real
