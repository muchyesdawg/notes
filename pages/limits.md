- definition
	- limits are a way to find the value of a function as the input approaches a number
	- explanation
		- assuming for $$f\left(x\right)$$,  all values of $$x$$ is defined from -$$\infty$$ to +$$\infty$$ in $$f\left(x\right)$$, except possibly at $$c$$
		- then as $$x$$ approaches $$c$$, then
		- $$\lim_{x\to c^+}f\left(x\right)=L_1\&\lim_{x\to c^-}f\left(x\right)=L_2\\$$
		                                                                                and
		- $$\lim_{x\to c^+}f\left(x\right) ↔ L_1 = L_2$$
