- c4 phtoosynthesis
	- modification for dry environments. c4 plants exhibit modified anatomy and biochemical pathways, which enables them to minimize excessive water loss and maximize sugar production
- calvin cycle
  id:: 636677d3-79b0-49ec-beba-8f88d2d39e89
	- cyclical process that produces sugar.occures during the light independent reactioons
- carbon fixation
	- incorporation of carbon dioxide into a sugar. occurs during ((636677d3-79b0-49ec-beba-8f88d2d39e89))
- cardiac sphincter
	- band of muscle at top of stomach that keeps acidified food in the stomach from backing up into the esophagus and burning it
- carotenoids
	- photosynthesis
- crossing over
	- normal process in which homologous chromatids exchange genetic material. increases variation of genetic material.
- cutin
	- coating on the leaves that helps prevent excess water loss from plant
- cyclosis
	- movement of cytoplasm around the cell
- cystic fibrosis
	- common lethal genetic disease in the us, 1 out of 25 has it.
- cytochromes
	- important proteins that are involved in etc in mitochondria and chloroplasts
- cytokinesis
	- division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms down the middle of the cell as the cytoplasm pinches inward and the two daughter cells separate from each other.
- cytokinins
	- plant hormones that stimulate cell division and cytokinesis.
- cytoplasm
	- region between nucleus and plasma membrane
- cytosol
	- semi liquid portion of cytoplasm
