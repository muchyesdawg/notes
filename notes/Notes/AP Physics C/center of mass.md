given a uniform rectangular plate with mass M with width A and height B
$$M-\int dm=\int^\alpha_0\sigma bdx=\sigma bx|^\alpha_0=\sigma ba$$
$$\vec{x}_{CM}=\dfrac{1}{M}\sum^{n}_{1=1}m_i\vec x_i =\dfrac{1}{M}\int xdm$$
$$\sum^n_{m}m_i\vec x_i=\int xdm$$

how to solve the half hoop $CM$ problem
First understand the first part of center of mass integrals somehow hopefully
# $x_{cm}$ equations
there are two different equations to find the center of mass, one is discrete (the first one), where the other is concrete (the second one)
$$x_{cm}=\dfrac{\sum^n_{i=1}m_ix_i}{\sum^n_{i=1}m_i}$$
the reason this works is because assuming there are $n$ amount of objects and each correspond to $m_i$ and $x_i$, we can understand that the numerator gives us the total mass of the entire system, while the top mass gives us the sum of all the mass and their respective distances.
## linear mass density $\lambda$
Since density is $D=\dfrac{m}{v}$, the derivative of a mass is $\lambda=\dfrac{dm}{dx}$. what this means is over a certain amount of value of $x$, the mass is
