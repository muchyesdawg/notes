- pythag IDs
	- sin(x) and cos(x) works by drawing a line in the angle x on a unit circle relative to the positive x axis in a ccw direction, and finding the x(cos) and y(sin) values of where the line intersects.
	- if on a the unit circle exists a point (cosx,sinx), then 
	  $$\sin^2\left(x\right)+\cos^2\left(x\right)=1$$
	  due to the unit circle being a circle at the origin with a radius of 1
	- the other ID is derived by the previous formula. proof:
	  $$\sin^2\left(x\right)+\cos^2\left(x\right)=1\\\dfrac{\sin^2\left(x\right)}{cos^2\left(x\right)}+\dfrac{\cos^2\left(x\right)}{cos^2(x)}=\dfrac1{cos^2(x)}
	  \\\tan^2\left(x\right)+1=\sec^2(x)$$
