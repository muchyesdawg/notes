- ### Photosynthesis
	- $6CO_2+6H_2O+ \text{light energy} \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2$
	- is an endergonic reaction
	- has two parts:
		- #### Light Reactions
			- Requires light to process
			- happens in the chloroplast
			- 
		- #### Calvin Cycle
			- Known Light Independent Reactions
- ### Cellular Respiration
	- $C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2\rightarrow6CO_2+6H_2O+\text{ATP (Energy)}$
