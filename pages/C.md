- c4 phtoosynthesis
  collapsed:: true
	- modification for dry environments. c4 plants exhibit modified anatomy and biochemical pathways, which enables them to minimize excessive water loss and maximize sugar production
- calvin cycle
  id:: 636677d3-79b0-49ec-beba-8f88d2d39e89
  collapsed:: true
	- cyclical process that produces sugar.occures during the light independent reactioons
- carbon fixation
  collapsed:: true
	- incorporation of carbon dioxide into a sugar. occurs during ((636677d3-79b0-49ec-beba-8f88d2d39e89))
- cardiac sphincter
  collapsed:: true
	- band of muscle at top of stomach that keeps acidified food in the stomach from backing up into the esophagus and burning it
- carotenoids
  collapsed:: true
	- photosynthetic antennae pigments. they are orange and yellow
- carpel
  collapsed:: true
	- female part of the flower, produce the female gametophytes, ova. each carpel consists of an ovary, stigma, and style. also called the pistils.
- carrying capacity
  collapsed:: true
	- limit to the number of individuals that can occupy one area at a particular time.
- cation
  collapsed:: true
	- positive ion
- centrioles
	- responsible for division of the cytoplasm in animal cells; they are not present in plant cells. They consist of 9 triplets of microtubules arranged in a circle
- centromere
	- specialized region of a chromosome that holes two sister chromatids together
- centrosome
	- consists of two centrioles at right angles to each other. important during cecll division.
- chemiosmosis
	- this is how atp is produced during oxidative phosphorylation. protons only flow through the special atp synthase
- crossing over
  collapsed:: true
	- normal process in which homologous chromatids exchange genetic material. increases variation of genetic material.
- cutin
  collapsed:: true
	- coating on the leaves that helps prevent excess water loss from plant
- cyclosis
  collapsed:: true
	- movement of cytoplasm around the cell
- cystic fibrosis
  collapsed:: true
	- common lethal genetic disease in the us, 1 out of 25 has it.
- cytochromes
  collapsed:: true
	- important proteins that are involved in etc in mitochondria and chloroplasts
- cytokinesis
  collapsed:: true
	- division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms down the middle of the cell as the cytoplasm pinches inward and the two daughter cells separate from each other.
- cytokinins
  collapsed:: true
	- plant hormones that stimulate cell division and cytokinesis.
- cytoplasm
  collapsed:: true
	- region between nucleus and plasma membrane
- cytosol
  collapsed:: true
	- semi liquid portion of cytoplasm
