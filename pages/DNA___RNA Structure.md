- In DNA/RNA, there are 3 parts
	- pentose sugar
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![pentose sugar structure](https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/125341/Figure_1.jpg?revision=1)
		- depending on which side is on top, the end of the DNA will take the name of that and of the sugar.(5' end and 3' end)
		- depends on what monomer it is
			- DNA
				- uses Deoxyribose
			- RNA
				- uses Ribose
	- phosphate group
		- attached to the 5' end of the sugar
		- an inorganic phosphate group(found anywhere)
		- bonded to the pentose sugar by phosphodiester bonds.
	- nitrogen base
		- DNA
			- ATGC
		- RNA
			- AUGC
		- pyrimidines
			- Thymine
			- Cytosine
			- Uracil
			- has one ring
		- purines
			- Adenine
			- Guanine
			- has two rings
		- Base paring rules
			- Adenine pairs with Thymine
				- has two hydrogen bonds
			- Guanine pairs with Cytosine
				- has three hydrogen bonds
	- there are three types of rna
		- Messenger RNA
		- Transfer RNA
		- Ribosomal RNA
