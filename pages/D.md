- Decomposer
	- organisms that recycle dead organic matter. some help the soil to be more fertile.
- dehydration synthesis
	- synthesizes two molecules together by the removal of water
- deletion
	- a mutation whjere a piece of a gene, or chromosome, is lost
- denature
	- characteristic of proteins
	- proteins losing shape and functionality
		- can happen due to temperature or ph levels
- DNA
  id:: 635c61ea-e34d-45b8-a801-ceb0220ad24f
	- heritable material, passed from parent to offspring.
- diastole
	- relaxation of ventricles of the heart. Normal diastolic pressure is 120 mm Hg.
- dicotyledon
	- plant whose seed easily breaks in two
- diffusion
	- the flow of molecules from a higher concentration to a lower concentration
	- passive transport
- digestion
	- enzymatic breakdown, hydrolysis of food so it is small enough to be absorbed into the body
- dipeptide
	- a molecule consisting of two amino acids
- directional selectrion
	- Changing environmental conditions give rise to this type of natural selection one phenotype replaces another in the gene pool
- disruptive selection
	- a type of natural selection that increases the numbers of extreme types in a population at expense of intermediate forms.
- divergent evolution
	- occurs when population becomes isolated from rest of species and becomes exposed to new selective pressures, causing it to evolve to a new species.
- DNA polymerase
	- enzyme that catalyzes the elongation of the new ((635c61ea-e34d-45b8-a801-ceb0220ad24f)) strand during replication
- domain
	- all organisms are classified in one of three domains, which are further divided to kingdom,  phylum, class, order, family, genus and species
- doudenum
	- the first 10 inches of small intestine.
