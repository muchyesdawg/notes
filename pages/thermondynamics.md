- thermodynamics
	- a branch of physics
	- deals with thermal energy and heat.
- variables
	- U internal energy   in joules
	- e  efficiency           in percentages
- internal energy
	- represented with the variable U
	- is the total energy of a system.
	- Thermodynamics is more concerned with delta U rather than actual value of U
	- ΔU = ΔE_thermal
	- thermal energy of a gas is sum of all microscopic kinetic energies of gas particles
	- Δ=3/2nRΔT
		- unlikely that this equation will appear on exam
		- used to show important direct relationship between temperature change and change in internal energy.
	- during thermodynamic process there are three possibilities for the value of internal energy.
	- there are three possibilities for value of internal energy.
		- internal energy increases
			- if energy is added to the system, the internal system increases, +ΔU. This is accompanied by an increase in the temperature of the system +ΔT.
		- internal energy decreases
			- if energy is removed from the system, the internal energy decreases. -ΔD. this is accompanied by a decrease in the temperature of the system -ΔT.
		- isothermal process
			- this is a thermodynamic process where the temperature remains constant, ΔT=0.
			- if temperature is not changing, then the internal energy is not changing. ΔU=0
- work
	- simplified to W
	-
	- it's a macroscopic transfer of energy
