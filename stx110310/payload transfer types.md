1. **Hohmann Transfer**
    - **Description**: A simple and efficient transfer between two circular or nearly circular coplanar orbits.
    - **Process**:
        - First impulse increases the orbit to an elliptical transfer orbit.
        - Second impulse circularizes the orbit at the destination.
    - **Efficiency**: Requires the least $\Delta v$ for coplanar orbits but takes longer.
    - **Use Case**: Commonly used for interplanetary missions or satellite repositioning.
2. **Bi-Elliptic Transfer**
    - **Description**: Transfer involving two elliptical transfer orbits.
    - **Process**:
        - First impulse takes the satellite to a higher apoapsis.
        - Second impulse changes the periapsis to match the target orbit.
        - Third impulse circularizes the orbit.
    - **Efficiency**: Can be more efficient than Hohmann for very large changes in orbital radii.
    - **Use Case**: Rarely used except for extreme orbital changes.
3. **Phasing Transfer**
    - **Description**: Adjusting the satellite's orbit to synchronize its position with the target (e.g., rendezvous).
    - **Use Case**: Docking missions, such as spacecraft rendezvous with the ISS.
4. **Plane Change**
    - **Description**: Alters the inclination of an orbit.
    - **Process**: Requires a lateral impulse.
    - **Efficiency**: Expensive in terms of $\Delta v$, especially at higher velocities.
    - **Use Case**: Adjusting orbital inclination for polar or sun-synchronous orbits.
5. **Low-Thrust Transfers**
    - **Description**: Use of continuous, small thrust (e.g., electric propulsion).
    - **Efficiency**: Saves propellant but takes much longer.
    - **Use Case**: Deep-space missions or station-keeping.
