- development of the atomic theory
	- several observations and prominent experiments have led to a greater understanding of atoms.
	- this section will cover the scientists that made such discoveries.

			- 1897
			- discovered that even atoms were divisible.
			- discovered the electron
			- theorized that an atom of matter has a mixture of positive and negative components.

		- Ernest Rutherford
			- a student of J.J. Thomson
			- made an experiment with charged rays from uranium crystals, and named then alpha and beta
			- he determined that they consist of streams of particles.
			- confirmed that the alpha particle is a doubly charged proton.(now known as a nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons)
			- used radioactive source to fire alpha particles through a thin sheet of gold foil
