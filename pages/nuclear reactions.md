- atomic number and mass number
  collapsed:: true
	- when the symbol for an element is used in a nuclear reaction, the atomic number and the mass number are written as subscripts and superscripts preceding the element's symbol.
	- the atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. the number of protons defines an element.
	- the mass number can show three important values
		- the mass number is the number of protons and neutrons.
			- since the atomic number is the number of protons only, the number of neutrons can be deduced.
		- the mass number is also the atomic mass.
		- the mass number is also the molar mass.(mass of one mole of atoms)
			- measured in grams per mole
- subatomic particles
  collapsed:: true
	- notes:
	  collapsed:: true
		- it is important to know the mass and atomic number of these basic particles when analyzing nuclear reactions
	- fundamental particles, like protons and neutrons, are most likely to be encountered in nuclear reactions.

- neutrino
  collapsed:: true
	- are often a product of radioactive decay and nuclear reactions.
	- A neutrino,ν_e, is a neutral particle with very little mass.
	- are more common in the universe than electrons and protons.
	- they do not interact with matter
	- has another varient called antineutrino  ̅νe
	- can be ignored in basic physics problems
- alpha particles
  collapsed:: true
	- is the nucleus of a helium atom without any electrons (2 protons and neutrons)
	- has a mass number of 4
	- is the biggest in the ((63c36683-0519-4a97-8ac7-ab77056bec48))
- beta particles
  collapsed:: true
	- an electron produced when a neutron undergoes a transmutation to become a proton
	- more info about neutrons: [[chemFundamentals]]((63c33173-3b84-43b2-abe4-e38481d8a6ab))
	- BETA PARTICLES ARE ELECTRONS
	- beta particles and electrons and electrons have too little mass to affect atomic mass noticeably.
	- beta particles and electrons has an atomic number of negative one
	- its basically an electron that got shot out of a nucleus.
- gamma radiation
  collapsed:: true
	- protons and neutrons can move between energy levels within the nucleus.
	- nuclear reactions can excite nucleons to higher energy levels (nucleons as in protons and neutrons)
	- when nucleons subsequently drop to lower energy levels, they emit photons.
	- photons emitted when nucleons drop are energetic compared to electrons
	- the energetic photons are called gamma rays. they are a form of electromagnetic radiation.
- #### isotopes
  collapsed:: true
	- an atom can have a variable amount of neutrons.
	- each element have several combinations of neutrons that allow atoms of that atom to be of a different flavor of the original.
		- example:
			- 12^6_C, 13^6_C, 14^6_C, with 6, 7, and 8 respectively.
			- 1^1_h and 2^1_h are isotopes of hydrogen, but if all the was made of the latter and not the former, then we would've gone extinct a long time ago
	- this means that the atomic number may stay the same, but the mass numbe r an change very much.
	- the isotope of an element is often denoted with the element followed by the mass number.
	- isotopes can vary in mass and stability.
- the strong force
  collapsed:: true
	- a force that attracts nucleons to one another.
	- it is the reason why protons are fixed to the middle and not repelling each other due to electrostatic forces.
	- it is stronger than electrostatic forces.
	- it operates within a short distance
	- neutrons help hold the nucleus together. it adds to the strong force.
	- every atom has an optimum mix of protons and neutrons
- mass energy equivalence.
  collapsed:: true
	- during nuclear reaction, the mass of the reactants at the start does not equal the products at the end of the reaction
	- the difference in mass is known as the mass defect, Δm
	- is associated with energy involved in a nuclear reaction.
	- amount of energy, E, associated with mass defect can be calculated using the speed of light in a vacuum, c, and Albert's e=mc^2, which is the mass-energy equivalence
	- under certain conditions, mass can convert into matter and vice versa.
	- nuclear reactions release energy by converting a small amount of the original mass into energy.
	- in nuclear reactions, reactants have more mass than the products formed during the reaction. in order to balance this, mass defect must be added to the products side of a reaction
	- when the symbol of each particle is replaced by the appropriate mass in the amu, then it becomes apparent that the products side is missing mass.

- Gamma rays
  collapsed:: true
	- are a result of radioactive decay reactions, including alpha and beta decay.
	- travels at the speed of light and have greater penetration than alpha and beta radiation
	- can only be stopped by dense materials like lead
	- does not affect the atomic number or mass number of the atoms
- Decay Rate
	- the rate which radioactive decay occurs is normally measured in half-life
	- calculating remaining grams after a certain amount of time's formula
		- initial amount in grams * 1/2^(time/amount of time in one half life)=result in grams
- #### fission and fusion
	- fission
		- reaction splitting a large atom into smaller atoms
		- involve in the release of energy
		- typically induced by shooting neutrons at larger atoms.
		- steps of nuclear fission
			- neutrons are shot at the atom
			- atoms turn into larger unstable atoms, so they undergo fission
			- the strong force no longer holds onto the protons, so they break off, forming two smaller nuclei
			- outputs nuclei, electron, and energy in the form of gamma rays.
		- is used in nuclear power plants
	- fusion
		- combining smaller atoms to make a larger one
		- involve in the release of energy
		- the
