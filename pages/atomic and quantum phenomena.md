	- the theory that matter is composed of indivisible unites, or atoms, come from the ancient Greeks.
	- At the turn of the nineteenth century, scientists changed a lot of their previous ideas about the composition and behavior of atoms
- development of the atomic theory
	- several observations and prominent experiments have led to a greater understanding of atoms.
	- this section will cover the scientists that made such discoveries.
		- J.J. Thomson
		  collapsed:: true
			- 1897
			- discovered that even atoms were divisible.
			- discovered the electron
			- theorized that an atom of matter has a mixture of positive and negative components.
			- created the "raisin cake model", or the "plum-pudding model".
		- Ernest Rutherford
		  collapsed:: true
			- a student of J.J. Thomson
			- made an experiment with charged rays from uranium crystals, and named then alpha and beta
			- he determined that they consist of streams of particles.
			- confirmed that the alpha particle is a doubly charged proton.(now known as a nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons)
			- used radioactive source to fire alpha particles through a thin sheet of gold foil
			- a screen sensitive to alpha particles surrounded the gold foil to record the strikes of alpha particles
			- if Thomson's model was right, the distribution of positive and negative components of gold atoms shouldn't greatly affect the path of positive alpha particles.
			- the evidence he wanted that would reflect his hypothesis was that there shouldn't be too many alpha particles deflected.
			- the result was some of the alpha particles deflected at extreme angles.
			- proposed that
				- the positive region inside the gold atoms were actually concentrated in a very tiny nucleus at its center.
				- atoms are mostly empty space
				- majority of the mass of an atom is concentrated in a tiny central nucleus
				- central nucleus is positively charged.
				- electrons orbit the nucleus
