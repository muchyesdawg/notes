# KINEMATICS
collapsed:: true
	- ## displacement #vocabp
		- straight line distance bewteen the initial and final points
		- has both magnitude and direction
		- symbol is delta x, delta means change, x means position
		- change in position of an object - delta x = xf-xi
		- can either be positive and negative
		- displacement doesn't equal distance
		- area under a velocity time graph
	- ## distance#vocabp
		- scalar(magnitude only)
		- path length traveled from one location to another, varies depending on the path
	- ## velocity#vocabp
		- symbol, $$v$$
		- equation is v=deltax/deltat
		- has magnitude and direction
		- units m/s
	- ## speed#vocabp
		- distance traveled over time
		- avg speed = total distance traveled/ total time
		- units m/s
	- ## Acceleration #vocabp
		- rate of change of velocity
		- opposite of deceleration
		- a vector
		- symbol $$a$$
		- positive acceleration increases velocity
		- can be caused by change of speed/direction
		- $$A_{avg}=\dfrac{V_f-V_i}{t}$$
		-
		- $$V_f=V_i+at$$

- # Forces
	- ## forces
		- push or pull
		- in newtons
		- causes change in velocity
		- is a vector
	- ## contact forces
		- result from physical contact
	- ## field forces
		- does not involve physical contact between two objects
	- ## inertia
	  id:: 64ff4313-75cf-4918-a37d-789e68b7ff27
		- resistance to change
	- ## weight
		- gravitational pull of the earth on an object on or near the surface of the weight
	- ## tension
		- a string/rope pulls an object which exerts a contact force
	- ## normal force
		- a fore exerted by a surface
		- perpendicular to the surface.
	- ## friction
		- parallel to a surface
		- opposes movement
		- ### static friction
			- the friction of an object when it is not moving
			- denoted with the $$\vec{F}_s$$ symbol
			- friction coeff constant is denoted with $$\mu_s$$
		- ### kinetic friction
			- the friction of an object when it is moving
			- denoted with the $$\vec{F}_{fk}$$ symbol
			- friction coeff constant is denoted with $$\mu_k$$
	- ## drag(air resistance)
		- opposes airborne movement
	- ## thrust
		- force of an engine that acts upon the object
		- symbol $$\vec{F}_{thrust}$$
	- ## free body diagram
		- diagram of the forces acting upon the objects
	- ## hooke's law
		- $$F_{spring} = k\Delta x$$
		- k is constant
	- ## unbalanced forces
		- collapsed:: true
		  $$\sum F = ma$$
			- summation of f equal to mass times acceleration
