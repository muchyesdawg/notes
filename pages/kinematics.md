- equations(works because fo the properties of a $$v/t$$ graph)
	- collapsed:: true
	  $$\Delta x=\frac{(v_f+v_i)t}{2}$$
		- this works because the shape below the line is a trapezoid
		  collapsed:: true
			- the smaller base of the trapezoid is $$v_i$$, and the bigger base is $$v_f$$
			-
		- the equation is essentially the area of a trapezoid
	- $$V_f=V_i+at$$
		-
	- $$x_f=x_i+V_it+\dfrac{at^2}{2}$$

	  $$V^2_f=V^2_i+2a\Delta x$$
		- the $$\Delta x$$ in $$V^2_f=V^2_i+2a\Delta x$$ can be changed to $$t^2$$
	- $$v_{avg}=\dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$
