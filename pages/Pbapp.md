	- this evidence of the theory of continental drift
- parallel evolution
	- two related species that have made similar evolutionary adaptations after their divergence from a common ancestor
- parasitism
	- symbiotic relationship
	- one organisms benefits while harming the other
- parenchyma cells
	- traditional-looking plant cell.
	- has primary cell wall that is thin and flexible but lacks a secondary cell wall.
- parthenogenesis
	- development of an egg without fertilization
	- resulting adult is haploid

- phenotype
	- traits that an organism express
- phenylketonuria
	- an inherited disease characterized by the inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine.
	- requires elimination of phenylalanine from diet, or else serious mental retardation will result
