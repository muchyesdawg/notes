- lacteal
	- structures within the villi that line the small intestine and that absorb fatty acids and glycerol inthe the lymphatic system.
- lactic acid fermentation
	- occurs when a body can't keep up iwth the increased demand for oxygen by skeletal muscles
- law of dominance
	- Mendel's First law that states that when two organisms, each homozygous for two opposing traits are crossed, the offspring will be hybrid but will only exhibit the dominant trait.
- law of segregration
	- during the formation of gametes, the traits carried on homologous chromosomes seperate.
- learning
	- sophisticated process in which the response of the organism are modified as a result of experience
- law of independent assortment
	- best demonstrated by the dihybrid cross. a cross that is carried out between two individuals hybrid for two or more traits that are not on the same chromosome. results in a phenotype ratio of 9:3:3:1
- leucoplast
	- type of plastid that stores starch
- leukocyte
	- white blood cells
- light dependent reactions
	- part of photosynthesis that doesn't require liight directly, only the products of the light dependent reactions
- light independent reactions
	- part of photosynthesis that doesn't require light
- limiting factor
	- factor that limits something
- lipid
	- type of organic molecule.
	- consists of one glycerol and 3 fatty acids
- locomotion
