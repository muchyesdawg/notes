- cellular respiration
	- is the process of converting energy storage molecules into atp
	- has two types
	- starts with glycolysis(splitting glucose into pyruvate and produces two atp)
- fermentation(anarobic respiration)
	- occurs when oxygen is unavailable
	- is very inefficient
	- uses pyruvate to change NADH to NAD+
	- has two types
		- depends on what is respiration occurring in
		- lactic fermentation
			- happens in muscle cells, bacteria
			- produces lactate
		- alcoholic fermentation
			- happens in yeast, bacteria
			- produces ethanol
			- produces 2CO2 as a byproduct
- aerobic respiration
	- starts with pyruvate going into a mitochondria(releases co2 in the process)
	- when pyruvate goes into mitochondria, nad+ turns into nadh+proton, goes through coenzyme A, and turns into acetyl coa
	- acetyl coa goes into Krebs cycle(happens within the matrix of mitochondria) and produces 2co2, 3nadh + 3 protons, atp, and fadh2
