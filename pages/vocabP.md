# KINEMATICS
	- ## displacement #vocabp
		- straight line distance bewteen the initial and final points
		- has both magnitude and direction
		- symbol is delta x, delta means change, x means position
		- change in position of an object - delta x = xf-xi
		- can either be positive and negative
		- displacement doesn't equal distance
		- area under a velocity time graph
	- ## distance#vocabp
		- scalar(magnitude only)
		- path length traveled from one location to another, varies depending on the path
	- ## velocity#vocabp
		- symbol, $$v$$
		- equation is v=deltax/deltat
		- has magnitude and direction
		- units m/s
	- ## speed#vocabp
		- distance traveled over time
		- avg speed = total distance traveled/ total time
		- units m/s
	- ## Acceleration #vocabp
		- rate of change of velocity
		- opposite of deceleration
		- a vector
		- symbol $$a$$
		- positive acceleration increases velocity
		- can be caused by change of speed/direction
		- $$A_{avg}=\dfrac{V_f-V_i}{t}$$
		-
		- $$V_f=V_i+at$$
