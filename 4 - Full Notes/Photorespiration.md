- **What is it?**
	- A plant's response to **dehydration**
		- **What happens when dehydrated?**
			- stopping $H_2O$ from leaving the system
			- stomata is closed
		- **What happens as a result?**
			- less access to $CO_2$ 
			- more buildup of $O_2$
			- perfect conditions for photorespiration
- **What happens during photorespiration?**
	1. Within [[Calvin Cycle]], instead of $CO_2$, $O_2$ is used
		- this makes a two-carbon compound
	2. Consuming  $O_2$ to and organic fuel
	3. release $CO_2$ without producing ATP or sugar.
- **How did it appear?**
	- Believed to have occured when rubisco first evolved when there wasn't much $O_2$
