- ### Photosynthesis
	- **What is it?**
		- $6CO_2+6H_2O+ \text{light energy} \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2$
		- is an endergonic reaction
		- has two parts:
			- #### Light Reactions
				- Requires light to process
				- happens in the chloroplast
			- #### Calvin Cycle
				- Known Light Independent Reactions
				- happens in the stroma
				- uses $\text{ATP}$ and $\text{NADPH}$ to convert $\text{CO}_2$ to $\text{G}_3\text P$
				- Returns $\text{ADP}$, inorganic phosphate, and $\text NADP ^+$ to the light reactions
	- **Why Is this important?**
		- Energy entering chloroplasts as sunlight gets stored as chemical energy in organic compounds
		- Sugar made in chloroplasts supplies chemical energy and carbon skeletons to synthesize organic molecules of cells
		- plants store excess sugar as starch in chloroplasts and other structures
			- roots
			- tubers
			- seeds
			- fruits
- ### Cellular Respiration
	- $C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2\rightarrow6CO_2+6H_2O+\text{ATP (Energy)}$
