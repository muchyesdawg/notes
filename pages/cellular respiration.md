- cellular respiration
	- is the process of converting energy storage molecules into atp
	- has two types
	- starts with glycolysis(splitting glucose into pyruvate and produces two atp)
- fermentation(anarobic respiration)
	- occurs when oxygen is unavailable
	- is very inefficient
	- uses pyruvate to change NADH to NAD+
	- has two types
		- depends on what is respiration occurring in
		- lactic fermentation
			- happens in muscle cells, bacteria
			- produces lactate
		- alcoholic fermentation
			- happens in yeast, bacteria
			- produces ethanol
			- produces 2CO2 as a byproduct
- aerobic respiration
