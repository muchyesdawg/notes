- equations(works because fo the properties of a $$v/t$$ graph)
	- $$\Delta x=\frac{(v_f+v_i)t}{2}$$
		- this works because the shape below the line is a trapezoid

		  collapsed:: true
			- the smaller base of the trapezoid is $$v_i$$, and the bigger base is $$v_f$$
			-
		- the equation is essentially the area of a trapezoid
	- collapsed:: true
	  $$v_f=v_i+at$$
		- this equation uses the properties of $$a$$, where $$a$$ is the acceleration of object/slope of the graph
		- since $$slope=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$, then $$slope\: \cdot\: \Delta x = \Delta y$$, rewritten as $$at = \Delta v$$
	- $$x_f=x_i+v_it+\dfrac{at^2}{2}$$
		- each of these terms do different to essentially build the trapezoid as mentioned in
		   [{{embed ((64ea470a-6ca6-4f10-8459-48b500a9c8c8))}}](logseq://graph/notes?block-id=64ea470a-6ca6-4f10-8459-48b500a9c8c8)
		- the trapezoid can be split into two parts, a square and a triangle
		- the square is calculated by $$v_i$$
		- the $$x_i$$ can be taken out if not necessary, as it only adds previous displacement

	  $$v^2_f=v^2_i+2a\Delta x$$
		- the $$\Delta x$$ in $$v^2_f=v^2_i+2a\Delta x$$ can be changed to $$t^2$$
	- $$v_{avg}=\dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$
