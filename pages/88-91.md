- 6.1 photosynthesis and cellular respiration provide energy for life
	- life requires energy.
	- most of these energy sources from the sun(made with photosynthesis in chloroplasts)
	- uses carbon dioxide and water molecules to create sugar and oxygen.
- 6.2 breathing supplies o2 for use in cellular respiration and removes co2
	- respiration refers to an exchange of gases
	- an organism obtains o2 from its environment and releases co2 as a waste product.
	- it is different from harvesting energy from food molecules by cells
	- breathing takes in o2 and passes it to the bloodstream, which carries it to cells' mitochondria, where atp is generated.
	- co2 is created as a byproduct from the process above, which gets expelled from the body.
- 6.3 cellular respiration banks energy in atp molecules
	- glucose(c6h1206) is the fuel that cells use most OFTEN.
	- glucose and oxygen(6o2) is used to create carbon dioxide(6co2), water(6h20) and energy, used to phosphorylate adp
	- this is a exergonic reaction(releases energy) that can happen spontaneously(as opposed to endergonic reactions that take in energy.)
