When a vector has a magnitude of 1, or $$\lvert\lvert\vec{v}\rvert\rvert=1$$ then the vector is known as a unit vector $\vec v= \hat v$. This is also known as a directional vector. The interesting property of this is that when you multiply a scalar to this vector, the vector will have the magnitude of the scalar in that direction. So from this, we can give the equation $$\vec v = \hat v \lvert\lvert\vec v\rvert\rvert$$
