- when replicating DNA, there are a lot of steps
	- the enzyme helicase separates DNA strands by breaking hydrogen bonds
	- single strand binding proteins attach to keep the 2 DNA strands seperated
	- primase RNA Polymerase makes RNA Primers
	- Then it splits off from here
		- the lagging strand (5') end
			- the lagging strand willbe synthesized discontinuously against direction of replication
			-
		- the leading strand (3') end
