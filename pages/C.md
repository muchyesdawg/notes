- centrioles
	- responsible for division of the cytoplasm in animal cells; they are not present in plant cells. They consist of 9 triplets of microtubules arranged in a circle
- centromere
	- specialized region of a chromosome that holes two sister chromatids together
- centrosome
	- consists of two centrioles at right angles to each other. important during cecll division.

	- this is how atp is produced during oxidative phosphorylation. protons only flow through the special atp synthase
- chitin
	- polysaccharide that makes up the exoskeleton of insects and the cell walls of fungi
- chloroplasts
	- type of plastid that carries out photosynthesis
- chorion
	- membrane that lies under the shell of an egg and allows for diffusion of respiratory gases between the outside environment and the inside of the shell.
- chromatin network
	- dna in the nucleus that is wrapped with special proteins called histones into a visible network
- chromoplasts
	- type of plastid that stores pigment that are responsible for the bright colors in fruit and flowers
- classical conditioning
	- type of associative learning.
- cleavage
	- rapid mitotic cell division of the zygote that begins immediately after fertilization
- cnidocytes
	- cells that house the stinger in cnidarians
- codominance
	- inheritance pattern where both traits show at once
- codon

  collapsed:: true
	- important proteins that are involved in etc in mitochondria and chloroplasts
- cytokinesis
  collapsed:: true
	- division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms down the middle of the cell as the cytoplasm pinches inward and the two daughter cells separate from each other.
