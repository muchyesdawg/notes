What is your favorite book and why?
    My favorite book is infinite, because it talks about parallel universes. The idea of parallel universes
is proposed by Stephan Hawking. He says that every decision you make will create a new universe. There is a 
different version that talks also about parallel universes, which is Schrödinger's cat. Schrödinger's cat is
if you put a cat inside a box with a chemical that has 50% of killing the cat within an hour. If you seal the box
and wait one hour, there is a parallel universe where the cat is dead, and another that is alive. Before those hours are up thoug,
the cat is both alive and dead. The book is basically that, but more complex.
    The book is about a guy that has lost his wife to a car crash, and that his wife drowned. Before crashing though,
the main character saw his physical self standing outside the car, watching him. Then he goes to a therapist, and the 
therapist introduces him to a drug that will allow you to travel to another universe. The entire story is very thrilling.
The story is celeverly made. The book's characters are interesting, the plot is interesting, and the ending is very interesting.
The parallel universes are, in my opinion, quite symbolic. They represent the different aspects of human behavior, and I think
the book's story really captures it. I think it is a fantastic book and it is really good.
